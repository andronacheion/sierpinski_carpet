# Sierpiński Carpet in Euclidean, Hyperbolic, and Spherical Geometries

This repository provides three Python scripts that generate the famous **Sierpiński carpet** fractal in three fundamental geometrical settings:

- 🟦 **Euclidean (flat)** — the classical version.
- 🌀 **Hyperbolic (negatively curved)** — drawn in the Poincaré disk model.
- 🌍 **Spherical (positively curved)** — projected on a hemisphere.
